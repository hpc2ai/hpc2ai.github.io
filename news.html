  <h2>HPC2AI Joins Discussions on AI and HPC at GTC 2025</h2>
  <p>The HPC2AI Research Center, represented by Professor Arthur Francisco Lorenzon from the Institute of Informatics at UFRGS, took part in the NVIDIA GTC 2025 conference, held in San Jose, California. GTC is one of the most important international events dedicated to Artificial Intelligence (AI), High-Performance Computing (HPC), and emerging digital technologies, bringing together global leaders from academia, industry, and government. The participation was supported by the Artificial Intelligence Institute at LNCC and aligns with Brazil’s strategic goals under its National AI Strategy (PBIA).</p>
  <p>During the event, HPC2AI engaged in a wide range of activities, including technical presentations, strategic meetings, and visits to research institutions and technology companies. Discussions with representatives from NVIDIA, Oracle, and other international partners addressed topics such as cloud-based AI infrastructure, hybrid HPC-AI environments, and energy-efficient computing. These conversations also focused on how to strengthen AI adoption in Latin America and support research and innovation through advanced computing technologies.</p>

  <p>The program also included interactions with researchers from Stanford University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), fostering new opportunities for international collaboration in areas such as machine learning, public health, and environmental monitoring. The HPC2AI team also explored the exhibition space, where hundreds of companies and startups—including Brazilian participants—presented the latest advancements in AI, robotics, edge computing, and data science.</p> 
  <p>One of the highlights of the conference was the panel on AI sovereignty, where representatives from different countries discussed the importance of developing national AI infrastructure, supporting local talent, and ensuring ethical and sustainable use of AI technologies. This debate resonates with Brazil’s ambition to strengthen its leadership in the digital era while promoting scientific autonomy and innovation capacity.</p> 
  <p>The participation of HPC2AI in GTC 2025 reinforced the center’s strategic role in connecting Brazilian research with global technological frontiers. The experience contributed to broadening international partnerships, bringing visibility to national initiatives, and identifying concrete paths for advancing the integration of AI and HPC in research, industry, and public policy. The mission also supports HPC2AI’s commitment to training the next generation of talent and building sustainable digital infrastructure for Brazil’s future.</p>

<h2>Prof. Philippe Navaux Honored with an Award Bearing His Name</h2>
<p>The Institute of Informatics at UFRGS proudly announces that Professor Philippe Navaux recently participated in two major events in Chile, receiving a distinguished honor in one of them.</p>
<p>In his first engagement, Prof. Navaux was a panelist at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in Santiago, during the official launch of the <strong>Second Latin American Artificial Intelligence Index (ILIA)</strong>. Speaking on the panel titled <em>Enabling Factors</em>, he highlighted Brazil’s strategic investments in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and their role in strengthening regional capabilities in AI.</p>

<p>During his second visit to Chile, Prof. Navaux took part in the <strong>Latin American Conference on High Performance Computing (CARLA 2024)</strong>. At this event, the newly established <strong>PHILIPPE NAVAUX AWARD</strong> was announced—a prestigious recognition created to honor researchers who provide outstanding mentorship and support to early-career students and scholars in Latin America and the Caribbean. Fittingly, Prof. Navaux was the inaugural recipient of the award that now bears his name.</p>
<p>This recognition reflects Prof. Navaux's exceptional dedication, leadership, and long-standing contributions to the HPC community and to the development of scientific talent in the region. It is a source of great pride for the entire Institute of Informatics.</p>
