<h1 class="section-title">About the HPC2AI Research Center</h1>
<p>The HPC2AI Research Center is a multidisciplinary research and innovation initiative embedded within the Institute of Informatics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil. Positioned at the intersection of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the center aims to address the increasing computational demands of modern scientific and industrial applications. By fostering synergies between parallel computing, data-driven algorithms, and AI-driven modeling, the center plays a critical role in advancing the frontier of digital science and technology.</p> 
<p>Our mission extends beyond basic research, encompassing the development of scalable, energy-efficient, and sustainable computational solutions for AI-centric workloads. The center's scientific agenda is rooted in the use of cutting-edge heterogeneous architectures—including multi-core CPUs, high-throughput GPUs, and domain-specific accelerators—combined with rigorous software engineering and algorithmic innovation. These capabilities are applied to address complex, real-world problems across domains such as climate modeling, computational genomics, industrial process optimization, smart cities, and autonomous systems.</p> 
<p>A key pillar of HPC2AI is its deep and ongoing collaboration with industry leaders. The center maintains strategic partnerships with major hardware and technology companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, as well as with cloud providers and AI-focused startups. These collaborations enable the co-design of hardware-software solutions, real-world benchmarking, early access to emerging technologies, and joint publications and patents. Industry engagement not only accelerates technology transfer but also ensures that our research remains grounded in practical challenges with high societal and economic impact.</p> 
<p>Equally central to our mission is the formation of highly qualified human resources in HPC and AI. The center serves as a vibrant training ground for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and professionals seeking specialization in performance engineering, parallel computing, machine learning, and intelligent systems. Through hands-on research projects, advanced coursework, and immersion in international collaborations, we cultivate a new generation of scientists and engineers prepared to lead the digital transformation of industry and academia alike.</p>
<p>The HPC2AI Research Center is also firmly committed to open science, reproducibility, and broad community engagement. We actively disseminate research artifacts and datasets, promote best practices in scientific computing, and develop reusable tools and software platforms. Furthermore, we organize workshops, technical symposia, and training programs—nationally and internationally—to enhance knowledge exchange, foster interdisciplinary dialogue, and strengthen the HPC and AI research ecosystem.</p>
