<h1 class="section-title">About the HPC2AI Research Center</h1>
<p>The HPC2AI Research Center is an innovative multidisciplinary initiative at the Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Positioned at the intersection of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the center addresses the growing computational demands of modern scientific and industrial applications. By combining parallel computing with data-driven algorithms and AI-based modeling, we aim to advance the frontiers of digital science and technology.</p> 
<p>Our mission goes beyond basic research; we strive to create scalable, energy-efficient, and sustainable computational solutions designed specifically for AI workloads. Our center utilizes advanced heterogeneous architectures, including multi-core CPUs, high-throughput GPUs, and domain-specific accelerators, while also focusing on software engineering and innovative algorithm design. These capabilities are applied to various real-world applications, such as climate modeling, computational genomics, industrial optimization, smart cities, and autonomous systems.</p> 
<p>A key strength of HPC2AI is our ongoing collaboration with industry leaders. We have established strategic partnerships with major companies like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Oracle, as well as with AI-driven startups. These collaborations enable hardware-software co-design, practical benchmarking, early access to cutting-edge technologies, and joint authorship of publications and patents. This synergy accelerates technology transfer and ensures our research is aligned with pressing societal and economic challenges.</p> 
<p>Training highly skilled personnel in HPC and AI is fundamental to our mission. Our center provides a dynamic environment for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and professionals who want to specialize in parallel programming, machine learning, and intelligent systems. Through hands-on research, advanced coursework, and international partnerships, we prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers to lead the digital transformation in academia and industry.</p>
<p>HPC2AI is committed to open science, reproducibility, and community engagement. We actively share research artifacts and datasets, promote best practices in scientific computing, and develop reusable tools and platforms. Additionally, the center organizes workshops and training programs at both national and international levels. These initiatives promote knowledge exchange and interdisciplinary collaboration and contribute to a stronger global HPC and AI research ecosystem.</p>
