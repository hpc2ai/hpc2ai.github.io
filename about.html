    <h1>About the HPC2AI Research Center</h1>
    <p>The HPC2AI Research Center is an interdisciplinary initiative hosted by the Institute of Informatics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil. Our mission is to bridge the fields of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), driving innovation in scientific research and advanced applications.</p>

    <p>The center aims to develop scalable, energy-efficient, and sustainable computational solutions for AI workloads, leveraging modern heterogeneous architectures—including CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators. By combining expertise in systems, algorithms, and machine learning, we work toward solving complex real-world problems in domains such as climate science, bioinformatics, industrial optimization, and smart infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Our team is composed of faculty researchers, graduate students, and collaborators from national and international institutions. We collaborate with industry leaders such as NVIDIA and AMD, as well as academic and government research labs, to advance the state of the art in AI and HPC integration.</p>

    <p>The HPC2AI Research Center is also committed to open science, reproducible research, and the development of tools that foster broader community engagement. We organize workshops, training programs, and scientific events to promote knowledge sharing and capacity building.</p>
